[betatester01](./betatester01) | `Metal Boop increased my speed a lot. Right now with Metal Boop I can push my printer speed a lot without losing quality. Also, I don't need to worry about cracked plastic Boop; I just install metal parts and I can stop worrying about heat softening plastic Boop parts. I really recommend Metal Boop to everyone.`

[betatester03](./betatester03) | `its the lightest contact probe i had on all of my printers, it is easy to assemble and pretty light. its sturdy enough to get good results without compromises. only negativ think i can say is that it will pull cash out of your pocket for one time xD`
