Parts in this folder should be printed prior starting with assembly of MetalBoop.

**jig_magnet_x1.stl** is used to help you with installation of magnet into oval hole. It makes sure that magnet sits in the middle. Jig is securely attached to two nearby M3 holes with M3 screws after magnet is coated in RTV and inserted into the hole. Then jig must stay on for 24h for RTV to cure.

**jig_rail_x2.stl** needs to be printed two times. These two parts are used to help secure MGW7 rail to the base plate in fully vertical position.

Detailed instructions on how to use jigs will be available soon with upcoming manuals.
