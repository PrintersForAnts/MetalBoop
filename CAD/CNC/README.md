Use following files for CNC machining depending on which version (2-part, 3-part) or toolhead you use (Dragon Burner v8, any toolhead). Technical drawings are used to mark threaded holes.

> [!NOTE]
> It is strongly suggested to use following links that are for **beta RC2** files that you should use which include all known discovered and fixed bugs up to date.
